    "# Getting started with the practicals\n",
    "\n",
    "***These notebooks are best viewed in Jupyter. GitHub might not display all content of the notebook properly.***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal of the practical exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises have two goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Give you the opportunity to obtain 'hands-on' experience in implementing, training and evaluation machine learning models in Python. This experience will also help you better understand the theory covered during the lectures. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Occasionally demonstrate some 'exam-style' questions that you can use as a reference when studying for the exam. Note however that the example questions are (as the name suggests) only examples and do not constitute a complete and sufficient list of 'things that you have to learn for the exam'. You can recognize example questions as (parts of) exercises by <font color=\"#770a0a\">this font color</font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each set of exercises (one Python notebook such as this one $==$ one set of exercises) you have to submit deliverables that will then be graded and constitute 25% of the final grade. Thus, the work that you do during the practicals has double contribution towards the final grade: as 25% direct contribution and as a preparation for the exam that will define the other 65% of the grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "For each set of exercises, you have to submit:\n",
    "1. Python functions and/or classes (`.py` files) that implement basic functionalities (e.g. a $k$-NN classifier) and \n",
    "2. A *single* Python notebook that contains the experiments, visualization and answer to the questions and math problems. *Do not submit your answers as Word or PDF documents (they will not be graded)*. The submitted code and notebook should run without errors and be able to fully reproduce the reported results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend that you clone the provided notebooks (such as this one) and write your code in them. The following rubric will be used when grading the practical work:\n",
    "\n",
    "Component  | Insufficient | Satisfactory | Excellent\n",
    "--- | --- | --- | ---\n",
    "**Code** | Missing or incomplete code structure, runs with errors, lacks documentation | Self-contained, does not result in errors, contains some documentation, can be easily used to reproduce the reported results | User-friendly, well-structured (good separation of general functionality and experiments, i.e. between `.py` files and the Pyhthon notebook), detailed documentation, optimized for speed, <s>use of a version control system (such as GitHub)</s>\n",
    "**Answers to questions** | Incorrect, does not convey understanding of the material, appears to be copied from another source | Correct, conveys good understanding of the material, description in own words | Correct, conveys excellent level of understanding, makes connections between topics\n",
    "\n",
    "## A word on notation\n",
    "\n",
    "When we refer to Python variables, we will use a monospace font. For example, `X` is a Python variable that contains the data matrix. When we refer to mathematical variables, we will use the de-facto standard notation: $a$ or $\\lambda$ is a scalar variable, $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{w}}$ is a vector and $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{X}}$ is a matrix (e.g. a data matrix from the example above). You should use the same notation when writing your answers and solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Two simple machine learning models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the practical curriculum of this course, we will use the Python programming language and its ecosystem of libraries for scientific computing (such as `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` etc). The practicals for the deep learning part of the course will use the `keras` deep learning framework. If you are not sufficiently familiar with this programming language and/or the listed libraries and packages, you are strongly advised to go over the corresponding tutorials from the ['Essential skills'](https://github.com/tueimage/essential-skills) module (the `scikit-learn` library is not covered by the tutorial, however, an extensive documentation is available [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first set of exercises, we will use two toy datasets that ship together with `scikit-learn`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset is named `diabetes` and contains 442 patients described with 10 features: age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements. The target variable is a continuous quantitative measure of the disease (diabetes) progression one year after the baseline measurements were recorded. More information is available [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/datasets/descr/diabetes.rst) and [here](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/diabetes.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset is named `breast_cancer` and is a copy of the UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) datasets (more infortmation is available [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/datasets/descr/breast_cancer.rst) and [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)). The datasets contains of 569 instances represented with 30 features that are computed from a images of a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass. The features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. Each instance is associated with a binary target variable ('malignant' or 'benign'). \n",

    "In the majority of the exercises in this course, we will use higher-level libraries and packages such as `scikit-learn` and `keras` to implement, train and evaluate machine learning models. However, the goal of this first set of exercises is to illustrate basic mathematical tools and machine learning concepts. Because of this, we will impose a restriction of only using basic `numpy` functionality. Furthermore, you should as much as possible restrict the use of for-loops (e.g. use a vector-to-matrix product instead of a for loop when appropriate).\n",
    "\n",
    "If `X` is a 2D data matrix, we will use the convention that the rows of the matrix contain the samples (or instances) and the columns contain the features (inputs to the model). That means that a data matrix with a shape `(122, 13)` represents a dataset with 122 samples, each represented with 13 features. Similarly, if `Y` is a 2D matrix containing the targets, the rows correspond to the samples and the columns to the different targets (outputs of the model). Thus, if the shape of `Y` is `(122, 3)` that means that there are 122 samples and each sample is has 3 targets (note that in the majority of the examples we will only have a single target and thus the number of columns of `Y` will be 1).\n",
